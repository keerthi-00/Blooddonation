				<h2>Our website</h2>
				<p id="1">Our website creates a platform for those who are in need of blood during emergency or in any another situation.</p>


				<p id=2>Today in the developed world, most blood donors are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation). Many donors donate as an act of charity, but in countries that allow paid donation some people are paid, and in some cases there are incentives other than money such as paid time off from work. People can also have blood drawn for their own future use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.</p>
					
					
				<p id="3">So our website consists of all the information about the donars so that the person who are ineed of blood can use this and contact them.
